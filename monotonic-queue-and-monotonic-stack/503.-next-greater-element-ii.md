# 503. Next Greater Element II

**Problem Statement- Input-Output** :

Find the next greater element in the array, given the array is circular. \
Output- List element greater than it. if do not exist return -1;

#### Example:

A =\[1,2,3,4,3]\
Output is res\[] = \[2,3,4,-1,4]

#### Approach

* When it comes to circular array, it can be done in 3 ways:\
  i. Expand the array twice and copy the array again  O(n^2)\
  ii. Making use of the % modulo operator. O(N^2)\
  iii. Stack
* Stack: Using stack we can solve with O(N)\
  Fill the stack with the indices in with least at the top. Maintain the stack only the highest one stack on peek otherwise pop out.

&#x20;**Algorithm** :

```java
java

class Solution {
   public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] A) {
        
        //The array is circular:
        //Now that we have to find the next element that is 
        //to use a stack :
        //but we have to search in a  circular pattern:
        
        //length :
        int n = A.length;
        //output: 
        int[] res = new int[A.length];

        //stack 
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();

        //push elements into stack :
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            stack.push(i);
        }
        //Traverse thru the arrray and place the elements to the stack:
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            res[i] = -1;

            //check if the stack can accomodate it:
            while(!stack.isEmpty() && A[stack.peek()]<=A[i]){
                //remove it from the stack:
                stack.pop();
            }
            if(!stack.isEmpty()){
                res[i] = A[stack.peek()];
            }

            stack.push(i);

        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
