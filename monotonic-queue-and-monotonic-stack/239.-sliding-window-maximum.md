# 239. Sliding Window Maximum

**Problem Statement- Input-Output** :

Find the highest value within the window size K\
Input: Array of integers and the window size.\
Output: Array of highest values in such windows.

#### Example:

nums= \[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]  Window Size =3\
return : \[3,3,5,5,6,7]

#### Approach

* This clearly is a variant of sliding window, but hints that we have to find the maximum each window which allows us to think of monotonic queue which arranges the elements in a descending order so we can fetch the top most element of queue as the answer for each window.
* The push and pop operations of the queue are only O(n)

#### &#x20;Algorithm :

```java
java

public int[] MaxInWindow(int[] nums, int k){

 //size of the input array:
 int n = nums.length;
 //declaring the output array:
 int[] res = new int[n-k+1];
 //declaring index for the resultant array
 int ri =0;
 
 //we can use a deque to store the index:
 Deque<Integer> dq = new ArrayDeque<>();
 
 //treverse thru the arry:
 for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
  //remove the smaller elements from the queue:
  while(!dq.isEmpty() && nums[dq.peekLast()] < nums[i]){
   //pop that value: we dont need smaller values:
   dq.pollLast();
 }
 
 //we need to check that the queue not exceed the range of K:
 if(!dq.isEmpty() && dq.peekFirst() == i-k){
  //move the window to the right :
  dq.pollFirst();
 }
 
 //add the element in to the queue:
 dq.offer(i);
 
 //keep checking if i reaches the window size K
 if(i>= k-1){
  res[ri++] = nums[dq.peekFirst()];
 }
 
 return res;
 
}

```
