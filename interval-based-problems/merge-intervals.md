# Merge Intervals

Example:&#x20;

<pre><code>Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
<strong>Output:
</strong> [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
<strong>Explanation:
</strong> Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].
</code></pre>

#### Idea :&#x20;

* Lets first sort the intervals in order based on the start value.
