# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

<pre><code>Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
<strong>Output:3
</strong><strong>Explanation:The substring is "ece" with length 3.
</strong></code></pre>

#### Approach

* Similar to the previous question except that k is always 2.
* Create a Hashmap to store the character along with the count. When the map size has reached the K value, decrement the count and remove from the map as the count hits 0.
* The sliding window will start with right and left at 0 and keeps adding elements into the hashmap as the move right.
* when the map size is hit , move the left to check if its unique.

#### Algorithm :

```java
java

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(String s) {
       
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int right =0;
        int left =0;
        int longest = 0;
        for(right=0; right<s.length();right++){
         char c = s.charAt(right);
            map.put(c,map.getOrDefault(c,0)+1);
            
            while(map.size()>2){
               char leftc = s.charAt(left);
               map.put(leftc,map.get(leftc)-1);
                
                if(map.get(leftc)== 0){
                    map.remove(leftc);
                }
                 left++;
            }
           longest = Math.max(longest, right-left+1);
            
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
```
