# 3. Longest substring without repeating the character

#### Example

<pre><code>Input: s = "abcabcbb"
<strong>Output:3
</strong><strong>Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
</strong></code></pre>

#### Approach

Use a Hashmap to keep track of how many times a character appeared in the string.\
Create a counter for all the characters that have appeared more than once, this allows us to move the window as we to have only the unique characters in the window





#### &#x20;Algorithm :

```java
// Some code

class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
      
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int right =0;
        int left =0;
        int longest =0;
        int count =0;
        
        for(right=0;right< s.length();right++){
            
            char c = s.charAt(right);
            map.put(c, map.getOrDefault(c,0)+1);
            
            if(map.get(c)>1) count ++;
        
            while(count>0){
                
                char leftc = s.charAt(left);
                if(map.get(leftc)>1) count--;
                map.put(leftc, map.get(leftc)-1);
                left++;
            }
          longest = Math.max(longest, right-left+1);
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
```
